# Venture_Funding

The Venture funding application is modeled to predict whether applicants will be successful in their 
business ventures through funding via Alphabet soup. This will be accomplished by creating a binary classifiction
model using a deep neural network.

* [Tensor Flow 2.10](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - an end to end machine learning platform.

* [keras](https://keras.io/about/) - A deep learning API written in Python running on Tensor Flow.


## Installations (see notes below)

```bash
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```
```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"
```
### Notes
Apple M1 Chip Users
The Apple M1 Chip is not currently compatible with a typical Tensorflow installation, but that's ok! You can easily run this program
using Google Colab.
